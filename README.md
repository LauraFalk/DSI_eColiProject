# DSI_eColiProject
Data Science Institute project attempting to create a model which reliably predicts Escherichia Coli levels in the Upper Santa Cruz River. The folders within this repo represent the multiple steps during this process. 

-1. Data: The Raw folder contains a set of all data used for this project. The Processed data contains processed data outputs. The processed data was used as model inputs and saved in this form to save processing time. 

-2: Exploration_ModelBuilding: Multiple coding languages, models, and validation procedures were used in the initial exploration of this project. This folder contains models which did not make the cut or other processes which are not currently used in the final model.

-3: Exploration_TousiReplication: Contains work related to replicating the study below with their data. The process was eventually run on the Santa Cruz data, but was not as effective as the final model:

-4: Final_DataProcessing: This folder contains a walkthrough of data exploration and data processing steps, replicable with the data included in the Data Folder.

-5: Final_ModelCreation: This folder contains walkthroughs of the final XGBoost model creation and LOOCV process.

-6: Final_ShinyApp: Contains unfinalized work on the ShinyApp. Final Shiny application will be placed in another repo.
